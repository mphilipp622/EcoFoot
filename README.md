# GreenGo

EcoFoot is an Android application that scans bar codes of food products and tells you how eco-friendly the manufacture of that product is. The value returned is calories per serving / estimated carbon footprint of the product. This effectively tells you if you get a lot of energy out of your food considering the carbon footprint of it.
